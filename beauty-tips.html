      <h2>
         <span class="whiteOnRed header-box">Tip&nbsp;1</span><br />
         Choosing a&nbsp;suitable typeface
      </h2>
      <p class="motto">Homogeneity is key.</p>
      <p>The choice of the typeface depends on the type of text that you are writing:
          <ul>
            <li>If your text contains characters from a&nbsp;different alphabet (e.g., Greek letters in mathematical formulas), you should ideally choose a&nbsp;font that includes all the characters you need. This ensures aesthetical consistency of the main text with the foreign characters.</li>
            <li>If your text contains a&nbsp;larger amount of mathematical expressions (variables, formulae), there will probably be a&nbsp;large number of italic characters on each page. In this case, choose a&nbsp;typeface that features only modestly sloped italics<div id="hyperlinks">View the font on the Adobe website: <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/minion-3" target="_blank">Minion&nbsp;3</a></div> (say, Minion), because typefaces with strongly sloped italics (say, Adobe&nbsp;Garamond) make the page look inhomogeneous.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
         <div class="picture">
            <img src="images/examples/formula_minion_agaramond.gif" width="150" height="150" border="0"/>
         </div>
         <div class="caption">
           An&nbsp;illustration how the slope of italics affects on the legibility of mathematical expressions:
           <ul>
                 <li>Minion (top): well-suited,</li>
                 <li>Adobe Caslon Pro (middle): less suited,</li>
                 <li>Adobe Garamond Pro (bottom): less suited.</li>
           </ul>
           Why is Minion better suited than Caslon and Garamond?  The strongly sloped italics of Caslon and Garamond make the ascende of the italic <i>f</i> collide with the opening parenthesis. The same holds for the italic <em>x</em> and the superscript. With Minion Pro, these problems do&nbsp;not arise due to its less strongly sloped italic cut.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="clearfloat"></div>
      <p>Here are some recommendations concerning typefaces that are suited for mathematics-heavy texts:
          <ul>
            <li><div id="hyperlinks">Nature homepage:<br /><a href="https://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">
            				www.nature.com</a></div>Minion (from Adobe, used, e.g., by <em>Nature</em>): includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols, italics with a&nbsp;moderate slope.</li>
            <li>Palatino Linotype: bundled with Microsoft Windows, includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols,</li>
            <li>Times New Roman: bundled with Microsoft Windows, includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols.</li>
            <li>Meta&nbsp;Pro (from FontShop), suited for headlines, includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols, italics with a&nbsp;moderate slope.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Be reluctant to use sans-serif typefaces (like <span class="Stil1">Arial</span>) for mathematical texts! For many sans-serif typefaces it holds that some of their characters (e.g., upper-case <i>I</i> and lower-case <i>l</i>) look virtually identical. This would make the respective variables indistinguishable.</p>

      <h2>
          <span class="whiteOnRed header-box">Tip&nbsp;2</span><br />
          Choosing a suitable font size
      </h2>
      <p class="motto">Smaller is better.</p>
  	   <p>A&nbsp;common misperception concerning font sizes is that a&nbsp;larger size will make a&nbsp;text more legible. Actually, larger font sizes can decrease legibility. This is because we do not read texts letter by letter, but rather perceive entire words, or even groups of words, at once. A&nbsp;larger font size makes fewer letters fit into the focus area that humans perceive clearly, thereby slowing down reading.</p>
  	   <p>This is the reason why you hardly encounter any newspaper, magazine, or commercial book being typeset in a&nbsp;font size larger than 11&nbsp;pt.</p>
  	   <p>Hence, as a&nbsp;rule of thumb, I&nbsp;would advise to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;font size of 11&nbsp;pt for body text.</p>

      <h2>
         <span class="whiteOnRed header-box">Tip&nbsp;3</span><br />
         Choosing a&nbsp;suitable line width
      </h2>
  	   <p class="motto">Shorter is better.</p>
         <p>When you look at newspapers, magazines and books, you will realize that either the page size is much smaller than standard paper formats for computer printers (like A4 or Letter) or that the text area is broken up into several columns. This is done to increase legibility: At the end of each line, our eye has to travel back left to the beginning of the next line. Finding the beginning of the next line is much easier with short lines.</p>
         <p>Moreover, relatively short lines give the reader and/or reviewers and/or thesis advisors large enough margins that they can use for annotations.</p>

      <h2>
         <span class="whiteOnRed header-box">Tip&nbsp;4</span><br />
         Choosing a&nbsp;suitable line spacing
      </h2>
      <p class="motto">More is&mdash;usually&mdash;better.</p>
       <p>Most scientific texts feature numerous footnotes, leading to a&nbsp;large number of superscripts in the text. Mathematical in-line formulae also frequently include superscripts and subscripts, calling for <em>enlarged</em> line spacing compared to nonacademic texts.
       <div class="figure">
          <div class="picture">
             <img src="images/examples/line_spacing_JEDC.gif" alt="Typography of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;" class="picture_border" style="width: 95%;" />
          </div>
          <div class="caption">
            A&nbsp;sample from the <i>Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control</i>: Insufficient lince spacing makes descenders of a&nbsp;line (like the &ldquo;p&rdquo; in &ldquo;procuded&rdquo;) conflict with superscripts in the subsequent line. To avoid such irrgular spacing, (a)&nbsp;increase the general line spacing and (b)&nbsp;use display formulas instead on in-line formulas for expressions that include multiple levels of subscripts or superscripts.
          </div>
       </div>
       <div class="figure">
         <div class="picture">
            <img src="images/examples/line_spacing_EJ.gif" alt="Typography of the &quot;Economic Journal&quot;" class="picture_border" style="width: 95%;" />
         </div>
         <div class="caption">A&nbsp;sample from the <i>Economic Journal</i>: The lince spacing was chosen to provide sufficient space so that superscripts and subscripts do not collide even in the presence of multiple formulas in consecutive lines.
         </div>
      </div>
  		</p>
  		<p>As a&nbsp;general rule, one should rather use a&nbsp;line spacing that is too big than too narrow.</p>
  		<p>However, there exists a&nbsp;deplorable custom to&nbsp;require students to format their (Master/<wbr>Ph.D.) theses &ldquo;double-spaced&rdquo; or something similar. This leads to an&nbsp;extremely ugly page layout which is usually characterized by&nbsp;too large a&nbsp;font-size and much too wide lines. You should avoid this wherever possible!</p>
  		<p>The origin of this custom is unclear. Behind it might be the idea that double spacing prodives supervisors with the space needed to&nbsp;insert comments and annotations. This, however, is&nbsp;achievable in an&nbsp;aesthetically much more pleasing&mdash;and for the reader also more comfortable&mdash;way: Reduce line width&mdash;and simultaenously line spacing&mdash;to create large (outer) margins which the reade can use for annotations.
  		<p>Thus, when facing the alternatives long, double-spaced lines vs. shorter lines with less line spacing, choose the latter.</p>

      <h2>
         <span class="whiteOnRed header-box">Tip&nbsp;5</span><br />
         Use style sheets
      </h2>
      <p class="motto">Styles help you achieve consistent formatting of elements of identical type, and they simplify your life.</p>
  		<p>The open-source typesetting system LaTeX is often praised for inducing authors to reason about the structure of their texts: In&nbsp;LaTeX, you enter formatting commands manually, such as:</p>
  		<p class="inputpar">\section{A First-Level Headline}<br />
  		\subsection{A second-level headline}<br />
  		This is the body text of the \emph{first} subsection.</p>
  		<p class="inputpar">\subsection{The next second-level headline}<br />
  		This is the body text of the \emph{second} subsection.</p>
  		<p>LaTeX then takes care of formatting all segments of the same type (say, <span class="input">\section</span>) in a&nbsp;consistent way: same font, same font&nbsp;size, same font&nbsp;weight, etc. And, importantly, it&nbsp;also takes care of consistent spacing, i.e. in&nbsp;front of each <span class="input">\section</span> there is a&nbsp;certain amount of white space, in&nbsp;front of each <span class="input">\subsection</span> there is a&nbsp;little less white space, etc.</p>
  		<p>Of&nbsp;course, using style sheets and creating own ones is also possible in Word&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co., and you should definitely make use of this possibility! Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>It induces you to deliberate about the structure of your text.</li>
  			<li>It creates a&nbsp;consistent formatting of everything the respective style sheet is applied to. This turns out to&nbsp;be especially helpful when adjusting the formatting: All you need to&nbsp;do is to&nbsp;change the style sheet <em>once</em>, and the format of all segments set in the respective style is updated automatically.</li>
  			<li>Most word processing softwares have a&nbsp;&ldquo;create table of contents&rdquo; feature. The success of this feature depends on the consistent application of style sheets, because the feature accesses the&nbsp;information contained in these style sheets to&nbsp;determine what belongs in the table of contents and what doesn&rsquo;t. For&nbsp;instance, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;table of contents that lists the first two hierarchical levels, everything labeled as  <span class="input">Heading&nbsp;1</span> and  <span class="input">Heading&nbsp;2</span> will be incorporated.</li>
  			</ul>

        	<h2><strong>Step 6: Respect units of meaning<br />
        	</strong>With justified text, not hyphenating will lead to very unevenly sized blanks across your text. Whenever possible, hyphenate according to units of meaning.</h2>
        	<p>Whenever the text admits it to hyphenate word according to their units of meaning, you should take advantage of that possibility. Hyphenating according to units of meaning increases comprehensibility of your text: It&nbsp;implies, e.g., that &ldquo;when-ever&rdquo; is preferable to &ldquo;whenev-er&rdquo; and &ldquo;bottom-less&rdquo; is preferable to &ldquo;bot-tomless&rdquo;.</p>
        	<p>By the way, the same principle applies also to units of meaning that span several words: It&nbsp;is advisable, like in this paragraph, not to separate expressions like &ldquo;It&nbsp;is&rdquo; at the beginning of sentences. The same holds for the article &ldquo;a&rdquo; and subsequent words, like in &ldquo;a&nbsp;house&rdquo;, and for numbers in&nbsp;front of or following words, like &ldquo;3&nbsp;mm&rdquo;, &ldquo;no.&nbsp;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2.5&nbsp;million&rdquo;. It&nbsp;also increases legibility not to&nbsp;separate cases like &ldquo;in&nbsp;general&rdquo;, &ldquo;too&nbsp;far&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&nbsp;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;to&nbsp;go&rdquo;.</p>
        	<p>Of&nbsp;course, this principle can probably in no&nbsp;text be implemented without exception. One should, however, try to obey it.</p>
        	<h2><strong>Step&nbsp;7: Use optical alignment/hanging punctuation</strong></h2>
        	<p>Our letters and punctuation symbols are characterised by a&nbsp;widely varying amount of white space surrounding them: Letters like &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;T&rdquo; and &ldquo;W&rdquo; or characters like &ldquo;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; (and especially the quotation marks &ldquo; and &rdquo; themselves) create a&nbsp;lot of white space. When such characters show up at the beginning of a&nbsp;line or at the end of a&nbsp;justified line, they tend to&nbsp;make the respective margin look ragged. Optical alignment (often also called &ldquo;hanging punctuation&rdquo;) outdents these characters slightly: Mathematically, their left terminals don&rsquo;t form a&nbsp;vertical line any more&mdash;but <em>optically</em> they do.</p>
        	<h2><strong>Step&nbsp;8: Use the correct typographical characters<br />
        	</strong>For instance, &ldquo;word&rdquo; instead of &quot;word&quot;</h2>
        	<p>The most frequently violations of correct typography are:</p>
        	<ul>
  			<li>Usage of vertical quotation marks (&quot;word&quot;) instead of the correct quotation marks that look like little 6s and 9s (&ldquo;word&rdquo;).</li>
  			<li>Hyphens instead of en-dashes (&ndash;) or em-dashes (&mdash;).</li>
        	</ul>
        	<p>Many people will probably reply to&nbsp;this by saying, &ldquo;Well, no-one will notice a&nbsp;difference.&rdquo; While this might be&nbsp;true on the level that people are not be able to spot the difference when asked for&nbsp;it, I&rsquo;m positive that they still comprehend a&nbsp;text with correct typographical punctuation quicker than one without. For instance, the correct quotation marks make a&nbsp;difference between the beginning and the end of a&nbsp;quotation&mdash;while the vertical ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
