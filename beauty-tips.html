          <h2><strong>Step&nbsp;1: Choose a&nbsp;suitable typeface</strong><br />
     				Homogeneity is key.</h2>
          <p>The choice of the typeface depends on the type of text that you are writing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
   If your text contains characters from another language (e.g., Greek letters in mathematical formulae), you should ideally choose a&nbsp;font which includes all the characters you need, to ensure aesthetical consistency of the main text and the foreign characters.</li>
            <li>If your text contains a&nbsp;larger amount of mathematical expressions (variables, formulae), there will probably be a&nbsp;large number of italic characters on each page. In&nbsp;this case you&nbsp;should choose a&nbsp;typeface that features only modestly sloped italics <div id="hyperlinks">View the font on the Adobe website: <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1721" title="Minion Pro Opticals by Adobe" target="_blank">Minion Pro</a></div>
            (say, Minion), because typefaces with strongly sloped italics (say, Adobe&nbsp;Garamond) make the page look inhomogeneous.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="fltlft"><div class="picture"><img src="images/examples/formula_minion_agaramond.gif" alt="Typography of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;" width="150" height="150" border="0"/></div>
          <div class="caption">
          		The influence of the slope of italics<br />
          				on mathematical text:
          		<ul>
          				<li>Minion Pro (top): well-suited,</li>
          				<li>Adobe Caslon Pro (middle): less suited,</li>
          				<li>Adobe Garamond Pro (bottom): less suited.</li>
          		</ul>
  				The strongly sloped italics of Caslon and Garamond<br />
          						make their italic <i>f</i>&rsquo;s ascender collide with the<br />
          						opening parenthesis.
          						The same holds for the <br />
          						italic <em>x</em> and the superscript.<br />
          						With Minion Pro, these problems do&nbsp;not arise.

          		</div>
          </div>
  		<div class="clearfloat"></div>
  		<p>Here are some recommendations concerning typefaces that are suited for mathematics-heavy texts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            		<div id="hyperlinks">Nature homepage:<br /><a href="http://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">
            				www.nature.com</a></div>
            Minion Pro (from Adobe, used, e.g., by <em>Nature</em>): includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols, italics with a&nbsp;moderate slope.</li>
            <li>Palatino Linotype: included in Microsoft Windows, includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols,</li>
            <li>Times New Roman: included in Microsoft Windows, includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols.</li>
            <li>Meta&nbsp;Pro (from FontShop), suited for headlines, includes Greek letters and some mathematical symbols, italics with a&nbsp;moderate slope.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I&nbsp;recommend not to use sans-serif typefaces (like <span class="Stil1">Arial</span>) for mathematical texts because some of their characters (e.g., upper-case <i>I</i>  and lower-case  <i>l</i>) often look virtually identical, leading to confusion of the respective variables.<br /><br />

  	   <h2><strong>Step 2: Choose a suitable font size</strong><br />
  Smaller is better.</h2>
  	   <p>A&nbsp;common misperception concerning font sizes is that a&nbsp;larger size will make a&nbsp;text more legible. Since we do&nbsp;not read a&nbsp;sentece letter by letter, but rather perceive entire words or word groups at&nbsp;once (maybe unless we encounter, say, a&nbsp;complicated name from a&nbsp;foreign language for the first time), larger font sizes can actually decrease legibility by making less letters fit into the focus area that we&nbsp;can perceive clearly.</p>
  	   <p>This is the reason why you hardly encounter any newspaper, magazine or commercial book being typeset in a&nbsp;font size larger than 11&nbsp;pt&mdash;and not the 12&nbsp;pt font&nbsp;size that is standard in Microsoft Word or in LaTeX.</p>
  	   <p>Hence, as a&nbsp;rule of thumb, I&nbsp;would advise to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;font size of 11&nbsp;pt for body text.</p>
  	   <p>The 12&nbsp;pt standard size in Word/LaTeX probably results from the fact that these applications were originally used to typeset document in A4/<wbr><nobr>US-Letter.</nobr> Note that this usually results in the need to&nbsp;decrease the line width! But, as a&nbsp;rule of thumb, I&nbsp;would advise to rather use a&nbsp;smaller font&nbsp;size with smaller line&nbsp;width than a&nbsp;larger font&nbsp;size with longer lines.</p>
  	   <p>This step is, of&nbsp;course, intertwined with the next two steps, so&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll probably have to&nbsp;go through a&nbsp;repetitive process: You start out choosing a&nbsp;certain font size, adjust line&nbsp;width and line&nbsp;spacing, assess the result&mdash;and then you start the process with a&nbsp;slightly decreased or increased font&nbsp;size again&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
  	   <h2>        		<strong>Step 3: Choose a&nbsp;suitable line width</strong><br />
  	   Shorter is better.</h2>
         <p>When you look at newspapers, magazines and books, you will realize that either the page size is much smaller than standard paper formats for computer printers (like A4 or Letter) or the text area is broken up into several columns. This is done to increase legibility: At the end of each line, our eye has to travel back left to the beginning of the next line. Finding the beginning of the next line is much easier with short lines.</p>
         <h2>        		<strong>Step 4: Choose a&nbsp;suitable line spacing</strong><br />
         More is&mdash;usually&mdash;better.</h2>
          <p>Most scientific texts feature a&nbsp;numerous footnotes, creating a&nbsp;large number of superscripts in the text. Mathematical in-line formulae also frequently include superscripts and subscripts, calling for an&nbsp;enlarged line spacing compared to non-scientific texts. Below you find examples of good and bad typography in such situations.
          <div class="fltlft"><br /><div class="picture_border"><img src="images/examples/line_spacing_JEDC.gif" alt="Typography of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;" width="630" height="100" border="0"/></div><br class="clearfloat"/>
  		<div class="caption">A&nbsp;sample from the <i>Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control</i>: A&nbsp;too narrow lince spacing makes descenders of a&nbsp;line <br />
  				(like the &ldquo;p&rdquo; in &ldquo;procuded&rdquo;, line&nbsp;3) conflict with superscripts in the subsequent line. Here, it even forces a&nbsp;totally <br />
  				uneven spacing of consecutive lines of text. Both severly harm legibility. The solution would be (a)&nbsp;an&nbsp;increase <br />
  				in the journal&rsquo;s general line spacing and (b)&nbsp;using display formulas instead on in-line formulas wherever the latter <br />
  				cause trouble.<br />
  &nbsp;		</div>
          </div>
  		<div class="fltlft"><div class="picture_border"><img src="images/examples/line_spacing_EJ.gif" alt="Typography of the  &quot;Economic Journal&quot;" width="630" height="100" border="0"/></div>
  				<br class="clearfloat"/>
  		<div class="caption">A&nbsp;sample from the <i>Economic Journal</i>: The lince spacing was chosen to provide enough space for superscripts and<br />
  				subscripts even with multiple formulae in consecutive lines.
  		</div>
          </div>
  		<br class="clearfloat"/>
  		</p>
  		<p>As a&nbsp;general rule, one should rather use a&nbsp;line spacing that is too big than too narrow.</p>
  		<p>However, there exists a&nbsp;deplorable custom to&nbsp;require students to format their (Master/<wbr>Ph.D.) theses &ldquo;double-spaced&rdquo; or something similar. This leads to an&nbsp;extremely ugly page layout which is usually characterized by&nbsp;too large a&nbsp;font-size and much too wide lines. You should avoid this wherever possible!</p>
  		<p>The origin of this deplorable custom is actually not clear to&nbsp;me. Behind it might be the idea that double spacing prodives supervisors with the space needed to&nbsp;insert comments and annotations. This, however, is&nbsp;achievable in an&nbsp;aesthetically much more pleasing&mdash;and for the reader also more comfortable&mdash;way: Reduce line width&mdash;and simultaenously line spacing&mdash;to create large (outer) margins which the reade can use for annotations.
  		<p>Thus, when facing the alternatives long, double-spaced lines vs. shorter lines with less line spacing, choose the latter.</p>
  		<h2><strong>Step 5: Use style sheets<br />
  		</strong>Using style sheets helps you structure your document and&nbsp;achieve consistent formatting</h2>
  		<p>The open-source typesetting system LaTeX is often praised for the fact that it induces authors to reason about the structure of their texts (besides the that it&nbsp;is for free): In&nbsp;LaTeX, you enter formatting commands manually (unless you use the Scientific Workplace front-end), like this:</p>
  		<p class="inputpar">\section{A First-Level Headline}<br />
  		\subsection{A second-level headline}<br />
  		This is the body text of the \emph{first} subsection.</p>
  		<p class="inputpar">\subsection{The next second-level headline}<br />
  		This is the body text of the \emph{second} subsection.</p>
  		<p>LaTeX then takes care of the task to format all passages marked, e.g., <span class="input">\section</span> in a&nbsp;consistent way: same font, same font&nbsp;size, same font&nbsp;weight, etc. And, importantly, it&nbsp;also takes care of consistent spacing, i.e. in&nbsp;front of each <span class="input">\section</span> there is a&nbsp;certain amount of white space, in&nbsp;front of each <span class="input">\subsection</span> there is a&nbsp;little less white space, etc.</p>
  		<p>This prevents the type of formatting that, e.g., Word documents often exhibit: In&nbsp;Word, many users are tempted to markup headlines by highlighting the text and then adjusting the font&nbsp;size manually, clicking the &ldquo;italic&amp;rdquo; or &ldquo;bold&rdquo; button, etc. Headlines belonging to the same hierarchical level share different fonts, different markups (say, some italic, some bold), different indenting, different leading/<wbr>trailing white space &hellip;</p>
  		<p>Of&nbsp;course, using style sheets and creating own ones is also possible in Word&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co., and you should definitely make use of this possibility! Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>It induces you to deliberate about the structure of your text.</li>
  			<li>It creates a&nbsp;consistent formatting of everything the respective style sheet is applied to. This turns out to&nbsp;be especially helpful when adjusting the formatting: All you need to&nbsp;do is to&nbsp;change the style sheet <em>once</em>, and all text passages set in the respective style are updated with the new format automatically. Thus, you should use style sheets right from the beginning of writing a&nbsp;text&mdash;and not only for the final, print version.</li>
  			<li>Most word processing softwares have a&nbsp;&ldquo;create table of contents&rdquo; feature. These are dependent on the consistent application of style sheets, because they use the&nbsp;information contained in these style sheets to&nbsp;determine what belongs in the table of contents and what doesn&rsquo;t. For&nbsp;instance, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;table of contents that lists the first two hierarchical levels, everything labeled as  <span class="input">Heading&nbsp;1</span> and  <span class="input">Heading&nbsp;2</span> would be incorporated.</li>
  			</ul>
        	<h2><strong>Step 6: Respect units of meaning<br />
        	</strong>With justified text, not hyphenating will lead to very unevenly sized blanks across your text. Whenever possible, hyphenate according to units of meaning.</h2>
        	<p>Whenever the text admits it to hyphenate word according to their units of meaning, you should take advantage of that possibility. Hyphenating according to units of meaning increases comprehensibility of your text: It&nbsp;implies, e.g., that &ldquo;when-ever&rdquo; is preferable to &ldquo;whenev-er&rdquo; and &ldquo;bottom-less&rdquo; is preferable to &ldquo;bot-tomless&rdquo;.</p>
        	<p>By the way, the same principle applies also to units of meaning that span several words: It&nbsp;is advisable, like in this paragraph, not to separate expressions like &ldquo;It&nbsp;is&rdquo; at the beginning of sentences. The same holds for the article &ldquo;a&rdquo; and subsequent words, like in &ldquo;a&nbsp;house&rdquo;, and for numbers in&nbsp;front of or following words, like &ldquo;3&nbsp;mm&rdquo;, &ldquo;no.&nbsp;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2.5&nbsp;million&rdquo;. It&nbsp;also increases legibility not to&nbsp;separate cases like &ldquo;in&nbsp;general&rdquo;, &ldquo;too&nbsp;far&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&nbsp;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;to&nbsp;go&rdquo;.</p>
        	<p>Of&nbsp;course, this principle can probably in no&nbsp;text be implemented without exception. One should, however, try to obey it.</p>
        	<h2><strong>Step&nbsp;7: Use optical alignment/hanging punctuation</strong></h2>
        	<p>Our letters and punctuation symbols are characterised by a&nbsp;widely varying amount of white space surrounding them: Letters like &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;T&rdquo; and &ldquo;W&rdquo; or characters like &ldquo;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; (and especially the quotation marks &ldquo; and &rdquo; themselves) create a&nbsp;lot of white space. When such characters show up at the beginning of a&nbsp;line or at the end of a&nbsp;justified line, they tend to&nbsp;make the respective margin look ragged. Optical alignment (often also called &ldquo;hanging punctuation&rdquo;) outdents these characters slightly: Mathematically, their left terminals don&rsquo;t form a&nbsp;vertical line any more&mdash;but <em>optically</em> they do.</p>
        	<h2><strong>Step&nbsp;8: Use the correct typographical characters<br />
        	</strong>For instance, &ldquo;word&rdquo; instead of &quot;word&quot;</h2>
        	<p>The most frequently violations of correct typography are:</p>
        	<ul>
  			<li>Usage of vertical quotation marks (&quot;word&quot;) instead of the correct quotation marks that look like little 6s and 9s (&ldquo;word&rdquo;).</li>
  			<li>Hyphens instead of en-dashes (&ndash;) or em-dashes (&mdash;).</li>
        	</ul>
        	<p>Many people will probably reply to&nbsp;this by saying, &ldquo;Well, no-one will notice a&nbsp;difference.&rdquo; While this might be&nbsp;true on the level that people are not be able to spot the difference when asked for&nbsp;it, I&rsquo;m positive that they still comprehend a&nbsp;text with correct typographical punctuation quicker than one without. For instance, the correct quotation marks make a&nbsp;difference between the beginning and the end of a&nbsp;quotation&mdash;while the vertical ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
